# LetMeCook 🍕

## What is LetMeCook? 🤔

LetMeCook is a useful application to provide an intelligent sous-chef for the user!

Users can scan vegetables, recognized via a machine learning model, and barcodes in order to add ingredients to their recipe.

Those ingredients will be used by the chatbot, who will keep in mind personal preferences and intollerances.  

## How to run? ⚙️

A .unitypackage file will be uploaded as soon as possible, making possible to build an .apk file which can be executed on the user's Android device.

### ⚠️ Please keep in mind that a Internet connection and a working device camera are required for the app to work. ⚠️
